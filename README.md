# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Our project is a sophisticated Gmail clone built using cutting-edge web technologies, including React, Vite, Firebase, and Framer Motion. By leveraging React, we've created a dynamic and responsive user interface that ensures a seamless email experience. Vite, our build tool, optimizes the development process with its blazing-fast performance and efficient hot module replacement.

To handle authentication, real-time database management, and cloud storage, we've integrated Firebase, ensuring robust backend support and secure data handling. The applicationâ€™s fluid and interactive animations are powered by Framer Motion, providing users with an engaging and visually appealing experience.
